# mytrics
This is a program that generates a bibliometric report for an author using the Scopus API (you'll need to add your own API key). Information is retrieved via ORCID or the Scopus author ID.

The output includes the h-factor and a variant I called the H5, with is the h-factor for papers published within the last 5 years. The H5 seems potentially useful as a window on more recent work, as opposed to the standard h-factor that can only increase over time. This might allow more relevant comparisons / better incentives in certain contexts, although all use of such metrics requires careful thought and caution (but of course - so does *not* using metrics).

The program also makes a crude prediction of the development of the h-factor over the next years.
